1. Who are the users and what do they know?
Lab Scientists, non-programmer.

2. What information users want from the system?
FTIR Plot.
Image Process. (with PyImageJ)

3. Use cases - how users interact with the system to get the information they want?
Following the interactive interface to generate a plot or possess image as they wish.

4. Preliminary project plan - what you plan to do in what order with the most detail on the next 2 weeks.
a. User Interface Development:
  Create an interactive UI framework that will:
  Display pop-up questions guiding users step-by-step through tasks.
  Dynamically respond to user input to enable FTIR plot generation and image processing actions.
  Key steps:
  Design a user flow to outline how the UI will interact with users, specifying types of questions, such as selecting files or choosing analysis options.
  Develop a prototype to establish the basic structure of the UI, ensuring it connects with backend functions for FTIR plotting and image analysis.
b. Core Function Development:
  Develop functions for FTIR plotting and PyImageJ-based image processing.
  For FTIR Plotting:
  Create code to import FTIR data, format it appropriately, and visualize it with customizable plot options.
  For Image Processing with PyImageJ:
  Establish basic image processing workflows like cropping, filtering, and enhancing images.
c. Testing and Feedback Collection:
  Run tests using a sample dataset and images to ensure functionality and user-friendliness.
  Gather feedback to adjust question flow, UI interactions, and any required refinements for ease of use.
