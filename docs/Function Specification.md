# Function Specification

The **Plot Generator** is an interactive script designed to provide users with functionalities to:

1. Generate FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy) plots.
2. Use ImageJ for image processing, such as color changes and intensity readings.
3. Exit the program when finished.

The tool guides users through each step and provides an easy way to interactively work with image files and FTIR data.

## 1. Who are the Users?
- The primary users are **Lab Scientists** who may not have programming experience. The tool is designed to be accessible to non-programmers, enabling them to efficiently process and analyze data.
- **Lab Scientists** often need to visualize and analyze experimental data, but traditional tools require programming skills or complex software setups for batch process, which can be barriers to efficient data analysis. This tool aims to overcome these barriers by providing an easy-to-use, guided interface.

## 2. User Information Requirements
- Users need to obtain **FTIR (Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy) Plots** for their datasets. FTIR is a crucial analytical technique used in labs to identify chemical bonds in a substance and understand molecular composition. Easy visualization of FTIR data is essential for users to make informed decisions during experiments.
- Users also want to perform **Image Processing** (using PyImageJ) to analyze images, apply filters, or enhance image quality. Image analysis is often needed for understanding experimental results, and this tool provides an accessible way to process images without extensive software knowledge.

## User Interaction Scenarios

### How Users Interact with the System
- Users interact with the system through a simple and guided **interactive interface**.
- They can choose to **generate an FTIR plot** or **process an image** by following on-screen prompts and selecting relevant files or options.
- The interface is designed to help users achieve their goals without requiring any coding knowledge. By using intuitive prompts and straightforward options, the tool ensures that lab scientists can easily process their data and generate visual outputs that are crucial for their research and analysis.
